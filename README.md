# Email Spam Classificator

In this notebook, our goal will be to create a model that allows emails to be classified as spam based on the words they contain. To do this, we will start with a dataset of more than 5000 examples, and we will create a model based on the logistic regression. Then, we will measure its accuracy and its behavior with false positives and negatives.

Finally, our model achived an accuracy of 97.58% and AUC of 0.97.
